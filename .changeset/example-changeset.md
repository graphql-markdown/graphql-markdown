Example changeset file demonstrating the format.

When you run `bun changeset`, it will create a file like this in the `.changeset/` directory.
The file includes:
- Package names that were changed (with version bump type: major, minor, or patch)
- A description of the change that will appear in the changelog

This example file should be deleted before the first real release.
